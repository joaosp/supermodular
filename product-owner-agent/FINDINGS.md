# Atlassian MCP Integration Findings

## ✅ SOLVED - Working Successfully!

The Atlassian MCP integration is now **fully working**. The agent can successfully fetch JIRA issues and other Atlassian data.

## Root Cause

**Wrong tool names in `allowed_tools` list** - The configuration used snake_case names (`jira_get_issue`) but the actual Atlassian MCP tools use camelCase (`getJiraIssue`).

## Success Example

The agent successfully fetched SDDEMO-3:
```
Summary: Implement product search caching to improve load times
Status: Refinement
Priority: Medium
Description: As users browse the marketplace, search results should be cached
to reduce API calls and improve performance. Consider implementing Redis or
similar caching solution with a 15-minute TTL.
```

## What's Working ✅

1. **MCP Server Connection**
   - mcp-remote successfully connects to `https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/sse`
   - Transport: SSEClientTransport (Server-Sent Events)
   - Connection logs show: "Proxy established successfully"

2. **OAuth Authentication**
   - Browser OAuth flow completed successfully
   - Tokens stored in `~/.mcp-auth/mcp-remote-0.1.29/`
   - Token file contains: access_token, refresh_token, scope, expires_in, token_type

3. **Tool Discovery**
   - Agent can list all 25+ Atlassian MCP tools
   - Tools are properly registered and visible

4. **Permission Handler**
   - Custom permission handler is being invoked
   - Correctly returns `PermissionResultAllow(updated_input=input_data or {})`
   - Debug logs show tools are being approved

## What's NOT Working ❌

1. **Tool Execution**
   - Every tool call returns permission errors
   - Error occurs AFTER our permission handler approves the tool
   - Suggests the error is from the Atlassian MCP server side, not the agent

2. **Scope Issue**
   - OAuth token scope is empty: `"scope": ""`
   - This might explain why permission errors occur

## Diagnostics Run

1. `python main.py check` - ✅ Agent initializes successfully
2. `npx mcp-remote https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/sse` - ✅ Connects successfully
3. `npx mcp-remote-client https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/sse` - ✅ Connects, no tools listed
4. Tool permission handler tests - ✅ Approving tools correctly
5. Actual tool calls (getJiraIssue, atlassianUserInfo, etc.) - ❌ Permission errors

## Hypothesis

The issue appears to be with the **OAuth token scopes** or **Atlassian site authorization**:

1. The OAuth token has empty scope (`""`)
2. The Atlassian MCP server might need explicit scopes to access JIRA/Confluence
3. OR: The user needs to authorize the MCP app to access their specific Atlassian site during OAuth

## Next Steps to Try

1. **Clear and re-authenticate**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/.mcp-auth
   # Then run agent again to trigger fresh OAuth flow
   ```

2. **Check Atlassian OAuth app settings**:
   - Verify which sites are authorized
   - Check what scopes/permissions were granted

3. **Try with explicit cloudId**:
   - Get the correct UUID cloudId (not the URL)
   - Test tools with proper cloudId format

4. **Contact Atlassian MCP support**:
   - The token scope being empty might indicate a server-side issue
   - Or documentation about required scopes might be missing

## Code Changes Made

### Fixed Issues:
1. Permission handler now returns correct `PermissionResultAllow` type
2. All query methods use `ClaudeSDKClient` with streaming mode
3. Removed unused `ATLASSIAN_SITE_URL` env variable (not used by mcp-remote)
4. Added comprehensive debug logging

### Files Modified:
- `agent/product_owner.py` - Permission handler, query methods, logging
- `.mcp.json` - Synced with code configuration
- Created test files: `test_mcp.py`, `test_auth.py`, `test_mcp_connection.py`
