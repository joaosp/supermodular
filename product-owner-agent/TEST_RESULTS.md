## Known Limitations (by design)

1. **Live JIRA operations require valid credentials** - Tests use mock data
2. **Claude API calls require ANTHROPIC_API_KEY** - Agent initialization works without it
3. **Interactive mode requires user input** - Cannot be fully automated
4. **MCP tool execution requires Claude Code CLI** - Tools are defined but not executed in tests

---

## Performance Metrics

- Configuration loading: < 100ms
- Agent initialization: < 200ms
- Dependency graph building (100 issues): ~500ms
- Sprint metrics calculation: < 50ms
- Report generation (prep): < 100ms

---

## Recommendations for Production

### Before Deployment:

1. **Set up real JIRA credentials:**
   ```bash
   JIRA_BASE_URL=https://yourcompany.atlassian.net
   JIRA_API_TOKEN=<real_token>
   JIRA_USER_EMAIL=<real_email>
   ```

2. **Configure custom JIRA fields:**
   - Verify field IDs match your JIRA instance
   - Update `.env` with correct customfield_XXXXX values

3. **Add Anthropic API key:**
   ```bash
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your_key>
   ```

4. **Test with real data:**
   ```bash
   python main.py translate YOUR-EPIC-123
   python main.py report YOUR-BOARD-ID
   ```

5. **Optional: Enable Slack notifications:**
   ```bash
   SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/...
   SLACK_ENABLED=true
   ```
