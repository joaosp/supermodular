## ü§î What Are Claude Code Agents?

Think of Claude Code agents as **specialized AI assistants** that are experts in specific areas of software development. Instead of having one AI that knows a little about everything, you can have:
- A **JavaScript Pro** that writes perfect TypeScript code
- A **Security Auditor** that finds vulnerabilities 
- A **Database Admin** that optimizes your queries
- A **Product Manager** that creates user stories
- And many more!

Each agent has been given specific instructions, context about your project, and expertise in their domain. It's like having a team of expert developers available 24/7!

## üí° Why Use Agent Templates?

These templates are **pre-built agent personalities** that you can customize for your project. Benefits include:
- ‚úÖ **Save Hours**: Don't write agent instructions from scratch
- ‚úÖ **Best Practices Built-In**: Each template includes industry best practices
- ‚úÖ **Consistent Quality**: All agents follow proven patterns
- ‚úÖ **Easy Customization**: Just fill in placeholders with your project details
- ‚úÖ **Team Collaboration**: Share agents across your team

## ‚ö° Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Create Your Agents Folder
```bash
# Navigate to your project root
cd /path/to/your/project

# Create the Claude agents directory
mkdir -p .claude/agents
```

### Step 2: Copy a Template
```bash
# Example: Copy the JavaScript Pro template
cp /path/to/templates/javascript-pro.md .claude/agents/javascript-pro.md
```

### Step 3: Use the Magic Prompt
Copy this prompt and paste it into Claude Code to automatically customize all templates for your project:

```
Please explore my codebase and automatically customize all Claude Code agent templates in .claude/agents/ by:
1. Analyzing my project structure, tech stack, and dependencies
2. Identifying the correct values for all placeholders
3. Replacing placeholders with my project-specific values
4. Keeping all best practices intact

Start by examining package.json, requirements.txt, or other dependency files, then look at the codebase structure.
```

That's it! Claude Code will customize all agents for your project automatically! üéâ

## üõ†Ô∏è Manual Setup Guide

If you prefer to customize templates manually, here's how:

### Understanding Placeholders

Templates use placeholders in square brackets that you need to replace:

| Placeholder | What to Replace It With | Example |
|------------|------------------------|---------|
| `[PROJECT_NAME]` | Your project/company name | "MyApp", "Acme Corp" |
| `[PRIMARY_FRAMEWORK]` | Main framework | "Next.js 14", "Django", "Express" |
| `[DATABASE_SYSTEM]` | Your database | "PostgreSQL", "MongoDB", "MySQL" |
| `[LANGUAGE]` | Programming language | "TypeScript", "Python", "Java" |
| `[PACKAGE_MANAGER]` | Package manager | "npm", "yarn", "pnpm", "pip" |
| `[API_ROUTES_PATH]` | API directory | "app/api", "src/routes", "api/" |
| `[AUTH_SYSTEM]` | Authentication | "Auth0", "Supabase Auth", "JWT" |
| `[DOMAIN_CONTEXT]` | Your business domain | "e-commerce", "SaaS", "healthcare" |

### Step-by-Step Manual Customization

1. **Open a template file** in your favorite editor
2. **Read the placeholder documentation** at the top of each file
3. **Find and replace** each placeholder with your values
4. **Save the file** in `.claude/agents/` directory
5. **Test the agent** by asking Claude Code to use it

### Example: Customizing for a Next.js E-commerce App

Before:
```markdown
You are a specialized {PROJECT_NAME} {PRIMARY_FRAMEWORK} expert...
```

After:
```markdown
You are a specialized ShopifyClone Next.js 14 expert...
```

## ü§ñ Automatic Setup with Claude Code

### The Magic Prompt

This is the ultimate prompt to set up all agents automatically. Copy and paste into Claude Code:

```
I need you to set up Claude Code agents for my project. Please:

1. First, explore my codebase to understand:
   - Project structure and architecture
   - Technology stack (check package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod, etc.)
   - Database system (check for database configs, migrations, schemas)
   - Authentication method (check auth implementations)
   - Business domain (analyze models, routes, and features)
   - API structure and patterns
   - Testing framework
   - CI/CD setup

2. Then, for each template in .claude/agents/, replace these placeholders:
   - [PROJECT_NAME] with my actual project name
   - [PRIMARY_FRAMEWORK] with my main framework
   - [DATABASE_SYSTEM] with my database
   - [LANGUAGE] with my programming language
   - [PACKAGE_MANAGER] with my package manager
   - [API_ROUTES_PATH] with my API path structure
   - [AUTH_SYSTEM] with my auth implementation
   - [DOMAIN_CONTEXT] with my business domain
   - All other placeholders with appropriate values

3. Create a SETUP_SUMMARY.md file listing all the values you used

Please start by exploring the codebase now.
```

### Advanced Automatic Setup Prompts

#### For Monorepo Projects:
```
Explore my monorepo and set up Claude Code agents for each package/app. 
Check the root package.json/lerna.json/nx.json to understand the structure, 
then customize agents for the main application considering all shared packages.
```

#### For Microservices:
```
Analyze my microservices architecture and create specialized agents for each service.
Look for docker-compose.yml, kubernetes configs, or service directories to understand
the service boundaries and customize agents accordingly.
```

#### For Legacy Codebases:
```
This is a legacy codebase that needs modernization. Set up agents that understand
both the current state and our target architecture. Check for TODO comments,
deprecated patterns, and technical debt markers to inform the agent context.
```

## ‚ú® Best Practices

### 1. Start Small
- Begin with 2-3 agents most relevant to your current work
- Add more agents as you need them
- Don't overwhelm yourself with all 15 agents at once

### 2. Customize Gradually
- Start with the automatic setup
- Fine-tune specific agents based on your experience
- Add project-specific rules and patterns over time

### 3. Team Collaboration
- Share your `.claude/agents` folder via version control
- Document any custom modifications
- Create team-specific agents for your workflows

### 4. Agent Selection
- Use the right agent for the task
- Combine agents for complex tasks
- Let agents delegate to each other

### 5. Keep Agents Updated
- Update agents when your tech stack changes
- Add new patterns as you discover them
- Remove outdated rules and practices

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Agent not found"
**Solution:** Make sure the agent file is in `.claude/agents/` directory and has the `.md` extension.

### Problem: "Placeholders still visible"
**Solution:** You missed some placeholders. Search for `[` in the file to find remaining placeholders.

### Problem: "Agent gives generic advice"
**Solution:** Your placeholders might be too vague. Be specific about your tech stack and requirements.

### Problem: "Agent doesn't understand my project"
**Solution:** Add more context to the agent file, including:
- Project-specific patterns
- Custom conventions
- Business logic rules
- Team preferences

### Problem: "Too many agents to manage"
**Solution:** Start with essential agents only:
1. `javascript-pro` (or your language expert)
2. `code-reviewer`
3. `debugger`
Add others as needed.
