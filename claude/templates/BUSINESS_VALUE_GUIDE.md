## Real-World Use Cases

### Use Case 1: New Feature Development

**Scenario**: Building a new API endpoint for customer feedback submission

**Traditional Workflow** (6-8 hours):
1. Design endpoint (1 hour)
2. Implement handler (2 hours)
3. Write tests manually (2 hours)
4. Security review (1 hour)
5. Documentation (1 hour)
6. Code review back-and-forth (1-2 hours)

**With Templates** (2-3 hours):
1. Start Task Command initiates workflow (instant)
