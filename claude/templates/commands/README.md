## ü§î What Are Claude Code Commands?

Claude Code commands are **pre-built automation workflows** that help you perform complex development tasks with a single request. Think of them as:
- üîß **Power tools** for common development tasks
- ü§ñ **Intelligent scripts** that adapt to your codebase
- üìã **Best practice workflows** codified and automated
- üé≠ **Specialized personas** Claude can adopt for specific tasks

Instead of manually performing repetitive tasks or explaining complex workflows step-by-step, you can invoke a command and Claude Code handles the entire process intelligently.

## üí° Why Use Command Templates?

Command templates provide:
- ‚ö° **Instant Automation**: Complex workflows ready in minutes
- üéØ **Consistency**: Same high-quality process every time
- üìö **Best Practices**: Industry standards built-in
- üîÑ **Reusability**: Customize once, use forever
- üë• **Team Alignment**: Share workflows across your team

## ‚ö° Quick Start (3 Minutes)

### Step 1: Create Commands Directory
```bash
# Navigate to your project root
cd /path/to/your/project

# Create the Claude commands directory
mkdir -p .claude/commands
```

### Step 2: Copy Templates
```bash
# Copy the templates you need
cp /path/to/templates/api-test.md .claude/commands/
cp /path/to/templates/security.md .claude/commands/
# ... copy any others you need
```

### Step 3: Use the Magic Prompt
Copy and paste this into Claude Code to automatically customize all templates:

```
Please explore my codebase and automatically customize all Claude Code command templates in .claude/commands/ by:
1. Analyzing my project structure, technology stack, and dependencies
2. Identifying the correct values for all placeholders in square brackets
3. Replacing all placeholders with my project-specific values
4. Removing any sections that don't apply to my stack

Start by examining package.json, requirements.txt, pom.xml, or other dependency files.
```

That's it! Your commands are ready to use! üéâ

## üìñ Command Usage Guide

### How to Invoke Commands

Once customized, you can invoke commands in several ways:

#### Direct Invocation
```
Run the api-test command for the /api/users endpoint
```

#### With Parameters
```
Execute the start-task command for ticket PROJ-123
```

#### Batch Operations
```
Run the security audit on the authentication module only
```

### Command Chaining

Commands can work together:
```
1. Start with the start-task command for PROJ-456
2. After implementation, run api-test to ensure coverage
3. Then run security audit on the new code
4. Finally, prepare the commit
```

### Command Customization

You can override defaults:
```
Run api-test but target 95% coverage instead of 90%
```

## ‚ú® Best Practices

### 1. Start with Core Commands
Begin with these essential commands:
- `api-test` - Maintain quality
- `security` - Ensure safety
- `start-task` - Manage workflow

### 2. Customize Incrementally
- Start with automatic customization
- Fine-tune based on your needs
- Add project-specific sections

### 3. Version Control
- Commit customized commands to git
- Track changes over time
- Share with your team

### 4. Regular Updates
- Update commands when stack changes
- Add new patterns as discovered
- Remove outdated sections

### 5. Team Alignment
- Review commands in team meetings
- Ensure everyone understands workflow
- Document any special customizations

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Command not found"
**Solution**: Ensure the command file is in `.claude/commands/` and has `.md` extension.

### Issue: "Placeholders still visible"
**Solution**: Run the magic prompt again or manually search for `[` brackets.

### Issue: "Command doesn't fit my workflow"
**Solution**: Commands are starting points - customize them to match your exact needs.

### Issue: "Tests are failing"
**Solution**: Ensure your mock patterns match your actual implementation.

### Issue: "Security audit too broad"
**Solution**: Comment out sections that don't apply to your stack.

## ‚ùì FAQ

### Q: Can I create my own commands?
**A:** Absolutely! Use these templates as inspiration for your own automated workflows.

### Q: How do commands differ from agents?
**A:** Commands are specific workflows/tasks, while agents are specialized personas. Commands often use multiple agents.

### Q: Can I modify commands after customization?
**A:** Yes! Treat them as living documents that evolve with your project.

### Q: Do commands work with all languages?
**A:** These templates are language-agnostic once customized for your stack.

### Q: How often should I run security audits?
**A:** Before major releases, after significant changes, or on a regular schedule (monthly/quarterly).

### Q: Can commands call other commands?
**A:** Yes! Commands can reference and trigger other commands for complex workflows.

### Q: Should I customize all commands at once?
**A:** No, start with the ones you need immediately and add others as required.

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Copy the templates** you need
2. **Run the magic prompt** for instant customization
